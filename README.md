# jQuery naaav

A simple, bare-bones jQuery drop-down menu plugin.

Just _another_ jQuery drop-down menu plugin :)

This one is a **super** basic one that's intended to just streamline the setting up of a drop-down navigation. It sets up event listeners and handlers, along with the in/out delays around a sub-menu's show/hide effect.

This was created to out of a want for a simple drop-down JS solution that:

1. Didn't try to do everything
2. Didn't try to write any markup or styles

You can pass in your own show/hide functions to completely customise the sub-menu display behaviour.

More doco coming soon!
